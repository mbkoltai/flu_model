Notes from 12/Apr/2023 meeting:
- we'll come up with a number of metrics to score seasons by year (issue: how do we define years? calendar year not very good. we probably want 'epi-years', but how to define)
- metrics could be:
	- find season onset/offset (cf. Naomi's Kenya paper, RSV papers [https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/225/6/957/6507738]) -> duration of season
	- season onset (month)
	- baseline vs peak (relative difference)
	- zero vs one vs multiple season(s)
- calculate these metrics for each year separately (so for country X, eg 2010 and 2011 are two separate datasets)
- do clustering on these n-dimensional (n=number of metrics, probably around 5-10?) vectors
- calculate by country: what % in cluster 1,2,3 - see if there is good clustering on the level of countries too?
- backup option: if many countries are scattered across clusters, we can calculate metrics first separately for years -> take averages by country (if it makes sense, eg. NOT for season onset, but rather calculate variation for onset timing) -> do clustering on averages
- opened GoogleDocs for defining metrics: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Aedj2KZ_O3TU99Bht-5RloUrIP4Ksdwe?usp=sharing
