Notes from UniFluVacc meeting 29/03/2023
Present: Simon, Naomi, Mihaly, Roz, Mark

1) discussion on how carryover of susceptibility is modelled: 
	a) susceptibility [S(t=0)] as a variable is reset each season, except for long-lasting vaccines w/ multi-year protection, when S(t) values carried over
	b) variation in susceptibility to different strains modelled as a parameter in the FoI term. In the SI of UK/Kenya papers there is carryover from one season to the next modelled as changes in this parameter

2) what countries to include as LMICs?
- Mihaly reviewed LICs/LMICs with population above 40 million in FluNet (WHO) database
- North African, South/SE Asian, South American countries tend to have continuous and relatively smooth time series
- sub-Saharan African countries tend to have data w/ few dozen positive samples, usually no obvious seasonality and data gaps
- large countries that (might) have geographic variation in flu seasonality: US, China, India, Brazil? (check this). Multiple models?
- we want to cover all world regions with L(M)ICs - choose countries by 1) data quality 2) population

3) how to fit and extrapolate data by country: 
- Roz raised that we don't have good enough data to fit country-by-cntr 
- instead we could analyse data and try to find archetypes/clusters of flu seasonality and extrapolate from a few base countries (UK, Kenya, Thailand - what if there are other types?)

4) how to use fitted parameters to do extrapolations
- parameters are separately fitted not just for countrs but also for seasons
- for a given country: take average over seasons or sample from fits across seasons and generate n>>1 sample trajectories (probably 2nd option)

5) data from 2020: we (probably) do not want to include post-2020 seasons as there are changes in reporting and (probably) seasonal dynamics (due to immunity loss)

TO-DOs:
- Mihaly will download & visualise FluNet data, have a look around for existing metrics of flu seasonality and see if countries can be clustered/scored 
- others will flag papers they recall/find on archetyping/clustering flu activity
