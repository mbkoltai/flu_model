Hi everyone, I've added @Mihaly who is joining the team now that we are officially in phase 2 (going from 3 countries to the rest of the world). Mihaly has kindly agreed to find a date to revive our weekly meetings.
For the first meeting, he is going to think about ideas to 
(i) take the fitted parameters from fit to three countries and leverage them to fit to other countries that may have virologically confirmed flu data 
(ii) extrapolate to countries without virologically confirmed flu but which may have general burden data from IHME/Edinburgh/etc.
Maybe we can all think about that together and then in the first meeting brainstorm ideas about how to do this.
@Roz and I are also part of wider meetings with WHO on next gen flu vaccines that will feed in more in phase 3, but might be relevant to phase 2 so will keep everyone in the loop here also.
Feel free to post comments/ideas/questions here even before the meeting!
